## Description

  This is the repository housing my homework for week #2! This week we were tasked to make our own portfoloio webpage from scratch using only the knowledge and tools given to us. In this project you will not only learn about me and what work I have completed, you will also see that I am able to build a funtional webpage from scratch. I show that I have the knowledge to build and adjust webpages. This webpage will show an about me, portfolio, future projects and contact info. Thank you for taking a look.

I will be able to add onto/spruce up this portfolio as I further my knowledge. I am excited to see where this learning can take me.
